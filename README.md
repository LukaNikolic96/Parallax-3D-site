**Captivating 3D Parallax Website**

Project Overview:
Welcome to the mesmerizing world of my 3D Parallax Website! This captivating project showcases an immersive web experience with stunning parallax effects that draw users into a visually engaging journey. As the creator and designer of this website, I aimed to blend cutting-edge web technologies, seamless animations, and an eye-catching design to leave a lasting impression on visitors.

Technologies and Languages Utilized:

HTML: The foundation of the website's structure, HTML provided the canvas on which I built the captivating user interface.
CSS: With CSS, I meticulously crafted the visuals, implemented smooth animations, and ensured a responsive layout for various devices.
JavaScript: Leveraging JavaScript's dynamic capabilities, I brought interactivity to the forefront, incorporating the mesmerizing parallax effect and cursor tracking.
Google Fonts: To enhance the site's aesthetics, I integrated Google Fonts API, carefully selecting 'Bangers' and 'Poppins' for the perfect balance of bold titles and clean, readable content.
GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform): GSAP proved to be a valuable ally in crafting fluid animations, orchestrating entrance effects with staggered delays using the powerful timeline feature.
Key Features and How It Works:

Mesmerizing Parallax Effect: The heart of the website is the enchanting parallax effect. Through the update function in JavaScript, I calculated the cursor position and adjusted the translation, rotation, and perspective of each parallax element. As a result, users are treated to an interactive 3D illusion as they move their mouse.

Seamless Animation: GSAP breathed life into the parallax elements, orchestrating their entrance with smooth animations. The staggered delays of GSAP's timeline feature added a touch of sophistication to the user experience.

Responsive Design: I paid meticulous attention to responsive design, using CSS media queries to ensure the website adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes. Users can enjoy the captivating experience across desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

Thoughtful Font Choices: The design decisions were driven by a focus on aesthetics and user experience. 'Bangers' exudes boldness for titles, while 'Poppins' maintains a modern and legible style for the main content.
